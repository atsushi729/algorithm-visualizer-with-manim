# Data Structure Visualization with Manim

## Overview

This project leverages the Manim library to create animations that visualize data structures such as binary trees, arrays, and linked lists. The animations demonstrate key operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal, aiding in the understanding of these fundamental computer science concepts.

## How to Execute the Code?

### Prerequisites

Before executing the animations, ensure you have Python and Manim installed. If Manim is not installed, you can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install manim
```

## Running an Animation

To run an animation script, navigate to the directory containing your script and use the following command in the terminal:

```bash
manim -pql your_script_name.py ClassName
```

### Notes:
`your_script_name.py`: Replace this with the name of your Python script.\
`ClassName`: Replace this with the name of the class in your script that extends Scene or another Manim class.

### Flags Explanation
`-p`: Preview the animation immediately after rendering.\
`-ql`: Render the video in low quality to speed up the process. Use -qh for high quality if necessary.
## Example
To run a binary tree visualization, use the following command:

```bash
manim -pql binary_tree_visualization.py BinaryTreeVisualization
```

This command will render the BinaryTreeVisualization scene from binary_tree_visualization.py and automatically open the video.
